<h2>About this project</h2>
A simple site that uses an API to help users search for recipes. 
It shows basic information such as photo, title, list of ingredients and the link to the original recipe. 


<h2>About EDAMAM API</h2>
The API used in this project is <a href="https://www.edamam.com/" target="_blank">EDAMAM</a>
They provide three different APIs, but for the purpose of this project I choosed the Recipe Search API. 
They offer more than 2.3 million recipes in English and they add new ones continuously. 


<h2>Technologies used</h2>
HTML, SASS and JavaScript


<h2>About the icons</h2>
The loader that appears everytime the API is called is from <a href="https://icons8.com/">icons8</a>. 
The icons used in this project are made by Freepik from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/" target="_blank">www.flaticon.com</a>. 


<h2>Next steps</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Allow users to mark recipes as favorites</li>
  <li>Implement the design!</li>
</ul>


<h2>‚ùóÔ∏è Problems</h2>
- For some reason, the SVG icons aren't loading in the deployed version.
